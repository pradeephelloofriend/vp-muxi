                            <p>The lives of local communities are closely interwoven with their environment, and are dependent upon their immediate resources for meeting their needs. These communities have a vast knowledge about local flora and fauna which is very important for biodiversity conservation. Much of this knowledge is orally passed on from generation to generation. Such indigenous knowledge needs to be recorded and preserved before it is lost. Despite all threats, diversity of the species and diversity within the species still continue to survive. Their continued existence is due to farmers and other communities living within and in the vicinity of the forest and other ecosystems. Their cultural practices and knowledge systems have helped nurture biodiversity. Nature worship is a tribal belief based on the premise that all creations of nature have to be protected. Such beliefs have helped preserve several virgin forests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the forests of God and Goddesses). These patches of forest or parts of large forests have been left untouched by the local people and any interference with them is banned, practice dating back to thousands of years.</p>
